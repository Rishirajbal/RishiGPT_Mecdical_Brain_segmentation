# RishiGPT Medical — Brain Tumor Segmentation
RishiGPT Medical Brain Segmentation is an advanced AI-powered component of the RishiGPT suite, designed to perform accurate brain tumor segmentation on medical CT scan images. It integrates a custom UNet++ architecture with modern conversational AI and knowledge retrieval capabilities using LangChain, Groq, and Gradio, delivering an interactive and explainable medical imaging assistant.

This project demonstrates a hybrid of deep learning and LLM-based interaction, enabling healthcare professionals, researchers, and students to upload brain scan images, run segmentation in the cloud, and receive structured outputs with contextual explanations.

**Key features:**

UNet++ Architecture: Fine-tuned for precise brain tumor segmentation using cross-sectional CT scan data.

Fully Cloud-Hosted: Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for seamless, zero-setup inference.

Explainability & Q&A: Integrated with LangChain to provide detailed answers about the model’s outputs and segmentation results.

Scalable & Modular: Built to support further extensions, including quantum machine learning experiments and hybrid classical–quantum workflows.
